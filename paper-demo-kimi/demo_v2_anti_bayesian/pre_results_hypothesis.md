# Paper Analysis: A Bayesian observer model constrained by efficient coding can explain 'anti-Bayesian' percepts  ## Citation Wei, X.-X., & Stocker, A. A. (2015). A Bayesian observer model constrained by efficient coding can explain 'anti-Bayesian' percepts. *Nature Neuroscience*, 18(10), 1509–1517. https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4105  ## Core Goal Unify efficient coding (neural representation) with Bayesian inference (decoding) to create a fully constrained observer model that can explain seemingly "anti-Bayesian" perceptual biases—where perception is biased *away* from prior expectations rather than toward them.  ## Central Hypothesis When sensory encoding is efficient (optimized for natural stimulus statistics via Fisher information maximization), the resulting likelihood functions become asymmetric in stimulus space. This asymmetry causes Bayesian inference to produce biases *away* from high-probability stimulus values—even though decoding remains Bayes-optimal given the encoding.  Key insight: "Anti-Bayesian" percepts are actually Bayes-optimal given efficient encoding constraints.  ## Method - **Framework**: Encoding-decoding model with two stages:   1. **Encoding**: Probabilistic sensory measurement m given stimulus θ, with Fisher information J(θ) ∝ p(θ)^2   2. **Decoding**: Bayesian posterior inference with p(θ|m) ∝ p(m|θ)p(θ) - **Efficient coding constraint**: Maximizes mutual information I[θ,m] under internal noise - **Novel theoretical contribution**: Mapping to "sensory space" F(θ) = cumulative of p(θ), where noise is homogeneous - **Test domains**: Visual orientation and spatial frequency (with known natural statistics)  ## Key Metrics/Measures - **Fisher information**: J(θ) = coding resources allocated to stimulus θ - **Bias**: Systematic deviation of percept from true stimulus - **Uncertainty modulation**: Comparison of external noise (stimulus degradation) vs. internal noise (coding limitations) - **Natural stimulus distributions**: Measured statistics f
