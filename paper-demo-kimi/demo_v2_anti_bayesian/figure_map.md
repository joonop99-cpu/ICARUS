# Figure ↔ Text map (A Bayesian observer model constrained by efficient coding...)

## Core figures selected

### Fig. 1 (p2)
- **Question**: How does efficient coding constrain Bayesian likelihood/prior jointly?
- **What is shown**:
  - Mapping from stimulus space to sensory space
  - Asymmetric likelihood in stimulus space emerges from symmetric noise in sensory space
- **Claim supported**: Anti-Bayesian-looking bias can arise from Bayes decoding when encoding is efficient.

### Fig. 3 (p4)  
- **Question**: Why do stimulus noise and sensory noise have opposite bias effects?
- **Panels**:
  - `a,b`: mechanism schematics for external(stimulus) vs internal(sensory) noise
  - `c`: likelihood/prior geometry showing attraction vs repulsion regimes
  - `d`: summary curve of perceptual bias vs noise source level
- **Visual semantics**:
  - Blue line(s): stimulus noise manipulation
  - Red line(s): sensory noise manipulation
  - Vertical dashed guides: prior center / reference points
  - Y-axis in panel d: perceptual bias (repulsive positive, attractive negative)
- **Main inference**:
  - Increasing **sensory/internal** noise tends to increase repulsive bias.
  - Increasing **stimulus/external** noise can reduce repulsion and eventually flip toward attraction.

### Fig. 4 (p5)
- **Question**: Does the model quantitatively match orientation-bias data?
- **Axes**:
  - x-axis: orientation θ (degrees)
  - y-axis: bias (degrees)
- **Line colors/conditions**:
  - Warm colors: higher sensory noise conditions (model prediction)
  - Cool colors: stimulus-noise conditions
  - Data panels compare measured points/curves against predictions
- **Claim supported**:
  - Bias is generally repulsive away from cardinal orientation under many conditions,
  - but noise-source manipulation shifts the magnitude/sign as predicted.

### Fig. 6/7 (p6–p7)
- **Question**: Does the same framework generalize to spatial frequency?
- **What is shown**:
  - Natural-statistics prior for spatial frequency and predicted bias curve
  - Psychophysical comparison under noise manipulations
- **Claim supported**: Framework generalizes beyond orientation.

### Fig. 8 (p8)
- **Question**: Are results tied to one specific neural tuning shape?
- **What is shown**:
  - Different neural population tuning families
  - Similar Fisher-information profiles can yield equivalent observer behavior
- **Claim supported**: The behavior-level predictions depend on effective information geometry, not one unique tuning-curve form.
